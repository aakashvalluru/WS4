1)Which algorithm is faster?
A) Bucket sort algorithm is faster than quick sort.
2)Where is the entry point of the application? (The place execution begins - provide the fully qualified class name and method name)
A)The entry point of application begin with class name class frmMain : Form and method name is 

3)What is the name of the code file that displays the main form?
A)frmMain.cs is the name of the code file  which displays the main form
4)What method does the main form constructor call?  Hint: look at frmMain.cs, right-click if necessary to "View Code", and then find the constructor (the constructor method name is the same as the class name.)
A)InitializeComponent() method is called by  main form constructor and  frmMain is the constructor
5)What is the fully qualified name of the class from which the main form is derived? 
A) Form is the fully qualified name of the class from which the main form is derived.
6)Add code to the Form1_Load method - use intellisense and your IDE to determine: What is this.tbSamples.Value? Set the default value to 10x your team number (if team 1, use 100). If this causes an error, read the error message carefully and make changes as needed.
A)this.tbsamples.value is track bar values is used to provide scrolling with a little different interface than a scrollbar.
7)What is this.cboAlg1?  Set its SelectedIndex to an integer so that the default is Bucket Sort
A)cboAlg1 is a combox ued to select the different type of sorts in the list
8)What is this.cboAlg2? Set its SelectedIndex to an integer so that the default is Quick Sort.
A)cboAlg2 is a combox ued to select the different type of sorts in the list
9)Use AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory.ToString() to get the base directory. 
A)
10)Create a new method called InitializeOutputFolder() and call it - see the suggested content below. What does this method do? 
A)This method stored the each stage of sorting algorithms in pictures.
11)What is this.cmdShuffle?  Call its PerformClick() method before exiting Form1_Load.
A)
12)What is this.cmdSort?  Change its appearance (e.g. ForeColor or BackColor) to highlight it so users will click it. 
A)
13)Make at least one other obvious improvement or customization as desired.
